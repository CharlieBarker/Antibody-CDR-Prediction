Modelling the structure of Complimentarity Determining Region (CDR) loop CDR-H3 is difficult. It has a remarkably varied structure that appears not to fall into any discrete structural classes. It is this loop that limits the accuract of antibody structural models derived from Homology Modelling. 

In this project, using the software abYmod as a base, I determined the most effective parameters to model CDR-H3. 

Additionally, I designed a machine learning algorithm that would predict the accuracy of the CDR-H3 loop given a sequence with unknown structure, based on the algorithms ability to predict known structures in PDB.
