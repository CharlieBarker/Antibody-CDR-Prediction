# abymod-masters-project

Elements of the project are split into folder. 

First, learnding (a silly Simpsons reference) contains the programming required for assessing multiple different modelling protocols for abymod,
used novemeber to january. 

Kinkdistance is the code for finding the distrubution of molecular distances between H100-103. 

Abymod folders contain abymod (mostly written by Andrew, but they also contain various different variants of buildmodel designed by me (charlie.))

Graphs contain the graphs and Rscripts used for data manipulation. 

machinelearning is a folder containing the scripts used to generate and prepare the data used for machinelearning. It also contains scripts used to analyse
the 14 different learning algorithms that were tested. 

QualityPredictor contains the program used for assessing loop model quality.
